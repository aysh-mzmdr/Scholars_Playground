# Scholars_Playground
An interactive learning platform that uses gamification elements to engage users. As we land on the website, we have the nav-bar displaying our league (unranked by default). As our score increases, we are placed in a higher league. On the right side within the nav-bar we have `Profile` to view our profile, `About us` to know more about the website, `Playground` section for the different subjects to play with, and the `Instructions` section for an explanation of what the website's league and score mechanism is.

The `Profile` Section opens up a new page where we are notified about our name, league, score, number of incorrect answers and the number of questions attempted

In the `Playground` section, we currently have five subjects each having five questions each. Each correct answer results in +100 score, while each incorrect answer results in -70 score. As we reach 500 score, we are placed in our first league, the `Bronze` league. Scores needed to reach the different leagues are mentioned in the `Instructions` section. Note that after answering a particular subject, the same questions can be re-answered. This feature is kept to allow the users to revise the questions again and again, as much they want.

The questions are MCQ type, with only 1 correct answer. The correct answer is highlighted in green after each question is answered. When all questions in a particular subject is answered, click the `Submit` button to go back to the home page.

The website has many animation effects, which are triggered either when scrolled to a certain section of the page or when the mouse is hovered over them. In case you get tired of solving questions, you can explore the website in search of these animations.
